# PYTHON INHERITANCE
"One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages
is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy
of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class
from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive
or inherit the properties from another class." from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-python/)

## What i learned in this project:
> Why Python programming is awesome
> What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
> What is a subclass
> How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
> When can an instance have new attributes
> How to inherit class from another
> How to define a class with multiple base classes
> What is the default class every class inherit from
> How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
> Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
> What is the purpose of inheritance
> What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions
